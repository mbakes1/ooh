# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive UI refactor of the digital billboard marketplace application to migrate the entire user interface to use shadcn/ui as the single source of truth for all UI components. The refactor will replace all existing UI elements with their shadcn/ui equivalents while preserving all application logic, state management, and functionality. The migration will focus exclusively on visual components and styling, implementing shadcn/ui blocks and pre-built patterns wherever applicable to maintain existing functionality while improving the visual design and ensuring a consistent design system throughout the application.

## Requirements

2. WHEN examining form elements THEN all inputs, buttons, selects, checkboxes, and form controls SHALL use shadcn/ui Form components with proper validation
3. WHEN inspecting navigation elements THEN all headers, sidebars, menus, and navigation components SHALL use shadcn/ui navigation patterns
4. WHEN checking layout components THEN all cards, containers, grids, and layout elements SHALL use shadcn/ui layout components
5. WHEN viewing interactive elements THEN all modals, dialogs, dropdowns, and overlays SHALL use shadcn/ui overlay components

### Requirement 2

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using authentication features THEN all login, registration, and password reset functionality SHALL work identically to before
2. WHEN managing billboards THEN all create, edit, delete, and status management operations SHALL function without changes
3. WHEN using messaging features THEN all conversation, message sending, and notification functionality SHALL remain intact
4. WHEN accessing admin features THEN all user management, analytics, and moderation capabilities SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN navigating the application THEN all routing, search, and filtering functionality SHALL work as expected

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement shadcn/ui blocks and pre-built patterns, so that complex UI sections are built using proven, accessible patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing dashboard layouts THEN shadcn/ui dashboard blocks SHALL be used for admin and user dashboards
2. WHEN building form layouts THEN shadcn/ui form blocks and patterns SHALL be implemented for all forms
3. WHEN creating data tables THEN shadcn/ui table components and data table patterns SHALL be used
4. WHEN implementing authentication flows THEN shadcn/ui authentication blocks SHALL be utilized
5. WHEN building complex layouts THEN shadcn/ui layout blocks SHALL be applied where appropriate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain responsive design and accessibility standards, so that I can use the application on any device with proper accessibility support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application on mobile devices THEN all components SHALL be fully responsive and functional
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN all components SHALL have proper ARIA attributes and semantic markup
3. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN all interactive elements SHALL be keyboard accessible
4. WHEN viewing with high contrast modes THEN all components SHALL maintain proper contrast ratios
5. WHEN using assistive technologies THEN all form elements SHALL have proper labels and descriptions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish a consistent theming system using shadcn/ui, so that the application has a cohesive visual identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the theme THEN shadcn/ui CSS variables SHALL be used for all color definitions
2. WHEN applying typography THEN shadcn/ui typography utilities SHALL be used consistently
3. WHEN setting spacing and sizing THEN shadcn/ui spacing tokens SHALL be applied throughout
4. WHEN implementing dark/light mode THEN shadcn/ui theme switching SHALL be properly configured
5. WHEN customizing components THEN all customizations SHALL follow shadcn/ui theming patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain proper component organization and import structure, so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows shadcn/ui conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing components THEN all shadcn/ui components SHALL be placed in the `@/components/ui` directory
2. WHEN importing components THEN all imports SHALL use the standardized `@/components/ui/*` paths
3. WHEN creating custom components THEN they SHALL be built as compositions of shadcn/ui primitives
4. WHEN managing dependencies THEN all required shadcn/ui dependencies SHALL be properly installed
5. WHEN structuring the project THEN the components.json configuration SHALL be properly set up

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure proper TypeScript integration with shadcn/ui components, so that the application maintains type safety and developer experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN passing props to components THEN TypeScript SHALL validate prop types correctly
3. WHEN handling form data THEN form schemas SHALL be properly typed with Zod integration
4. WHEN using component variants THEN variant types SHALL be properly defined and enforced
5. WHEN extending components THEN custom extensions SHALL maintain proper typing

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load efficiently with the new UI components, so that performance is maintained or improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading pages THEN the application SHALL maintain or improve current loading times
2. WHEN bundling the application THEN shadcn/ui components SHALL be properly tree-shaken
3. WHEN using dynamic imports THEN components SHALL be loaded efficiently
4. WHEN rendering lists THEN virtualization SHALL be maintained where currently implemented
5. WHEN handling large datasets THEN performance optimizations SHALL be preserved
