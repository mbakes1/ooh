# Messaging System Test

## Test Overview

This document outlines the testing of the secure messaging system implementation.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ✅

- Message table with proper relationships
- Conversation table linking users and billboards
- Foreign key constraints and indexes

### 2. API Routes ✅

- `/api/messages` - Send and retrieve messages
- `/api/messages/[id]` - Mark as read, delete messages
- `/api/conversations` - Create and list conversations
- `/api/conversations/[id]` - Get conversation details, mark all as read

### 3. UI Components ✅

- `MessageCenter` - Main dashboard for managing conversations
- `ConversationThread` - Individual conversation view with real-time updates
- `MessageComposer` - Rich text message composition
- `MessageSearch` - Search through messages with highlighting
- `MessageNotifications` - Real-time notification system

### 4. Features Implemented ✅

- Secure messaging between users
- Real-time updates via polling
- Message read status tracking
- Message search and filtering
- Email notifications (placeholder implementation)
- Unread message count in navigation
- Mobile-responsive design
- Message deletion (soft delete)
- Conversation management

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Create New Conversation

1. User visits billboard detail page
2. Clicks "Contact Owner" button
3. Fills inquiry form with message
4. System creates conversation and sends first message
5. Email notification sent to billboard owner

### Scenario 2: Reply to Message

1. User receives message notification
2. Navigates to messages page
3. Clicks on conversation
4. Types reply in message composer
5. Message sent and conversation updated
6. Real-time polling updates conversation

### Scenario 3: Search Messages

1. User navigates to messages page
2. Uses search functionality
3. Enters keywords to find specific messages
4. Results displayed with highlighting
5. Can click result to jump to conversation

### Scenario 4: Message Notifications

1. User receives new message
2. Unread count appears in navigation
3. Toast notification shows (if on site)
4. Email notification sent
5. Clicking message marks as read

## Security Features ✅

- Authentication required for all messaging endpoints
- Users can only access their own conversations
- Message content validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting considerations (to be implemented)
- Soft delete for message audit trail

## Performance Considerations ✅

- Pagination for message lists
- Debounced search to reduce API calls
- Polling interval optimization (5-30 seconds)
- Efficient database queries with proper indexes

## Next Steps for Production

1. Implement WebSocket for true real-time updates
2. Add actual email service integration (SendGrid/Resend)
3. Implement file attachments
4. Add emoji support
5. Implement message encryption for sensitive data
6. Add message reporting and moderation
7. Implement push notifications for mobile
8. Add typing indicators
9. Implement message reactions
10. Add conversation archiving
