# WebSocket Implementation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ WebSocket Authentication Issue

**Problem**: Test messages weren't showing up because authentication wasn't working properly.

**Solution**:

- Fixed the `connectWebSocket` function to properly handle authentication
- Added proper event handler setup before connection
- Added immediate authentication for already connected sockets

### 2. ✅ Removed "Users Online" Indicator

**Problem**: User requested removal of the "0 users online" text from sidebar.

**Solution**:

- Updated `WebSocketStatus` component to only show connection status
- Removed the online users count display

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Message Composer with File/Image Upload

**Problem**: Chat needed file and image attachment functionality.

**Solution**:

- Added file input for documents (PDF, DOC, TXT, ZIP, etc.)
- Added separate image input for image files
- Added attachment preview with remove functionality
- Updated `onSend` callback to accept attachments parameter

### 4. ✅ Functional Emoji Picker

**Problem**: Emoji picker was not functional.

**Solution**:

- Added working emoji picker with common emojis
- Implemented click-outside-to-close functionality
- Added emoji insertion into text area
- Proper focus management after emoji selection

### 5. ✅ Removed Voice Message Functionality

**Problem**: User requested removal of voice message feature.

**Solution**:

- Removed Mic icon and voice message button
- Removed related imports and functionality
- Cleaned up the toolbar layout

### 6. ✅ Fixed Test WebSocket Functionality

**Problem**: Test page wasn't properly testing WebSocket features.

**Solution**:

- Added proper WebSocket event emission for test messages
- Added typing indicator testing with visual feedback
- Added server-side handlers for test events
- Improved test feedback and logging

## Technical Changes Made

### Backend (server.js)

```javascript
// Added test message handler
socket.on("newMessage", (data) => {
  if (socket.userId) {
    console.log(
      `Broadcasting test message from ${socket.userId}:`,
      data.content
    );
    socket.to(`conversation:${data.conversationId}`).emit("newMessage", data);
  }
});

// Enhanced typing indicator logging
socket.on("typing", ({ conversationId, isTyping }) => {
  if (socket.userId) {
    console.log(
      `User ${socket.userId} is ${isTyping ? "typing" : "stopped typing"} in ${conversationId}`
    );
    socket.to(`conversation:${conversationId}`).emit("typing", {
      userId: socket.userId,
      isTyping,
    });
  }
});
```

### Frontend Components

#### WebSocket Client (`src/lib/websocket/client.ts`)

- Fixed authentication timing issues
- Added proper event handler management
- Improved connection reliability

#### WebSocket Status (`src/components/websocket-status.tsx`)

- Simplified to show only connection status
- Removed user count display

#### Message Composer (`src/components/messaging/message-composer.tsx`)

- Added file and image upload inputs
- Implemented emoji picker with common emojis
- Added attachment preview and management
- Removed voice message functionality
- Enhanced UI with proper tooltips and interactions

#### Test WebSocket Page (`src/app/test-websocket/page.tsx`)

- Added real WebSocket event emission
- Enhanced typing indicator testing
- Improved visual feedback for all test actions
- Added proper event listeners for typing events

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Enhanced Server

```bash
npm run dev:custom
```

### 2. Test WebSocket Connection

1. Visit any page and check the sidebar for "Connected" status
2. Visit `/test-websocket` for comprehensive testing

### 3. Test Real-Time Messaging

1. Open multiple browser tabs
2. Navigate to conversations
3. Send messages and verify instant delivery
4. Test typing indicators

### 4. Test Enhanced Message Composer

1. Click the paperclip icon to attach files
2. Click the image icon to attach images
3. Click the smile icon to open emoji picker
4. Verify attachments show in preview
5. Test sending messages with attachments

### 5. Test Emoji Picker

1. Click the smile icon in message composer
2. Select emojis from the grid
3. Verify emojis are inserted into text
4. Test click-outside-to-close functionality

## Performance Improvements

### Connection Reliability

- Better authentication flow
- Proper event handler cleanup
- Improved error handling and logging

### User Experience

- Instant visual feedback for all actions
- Proper loading states and indicators
- Enhanced file upload experience
- Intuitive emoji selection

### Developer Experience

- Comprehensive test interface
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Clear separation of concerns
- Type-safe implementations

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing

1. Verify WebSocket connection shows "Connected" in sidebar
2. Test message sending in `/test-websocket` page
3. Test typing indicators work properly
4. Verify emoji picker functionality
5. Test file/image attachment (UI only - backend integration needed)

### Future Enhancements

1. Implement backend file upload handling
2. Add file preview for images
3. Add more emoji categories
4. Implement drag-and-drop file upload
5. Add file size validation
6. Implement message encryption for sensitive files

## Troubleshooting

### If WebSocket Shows "Disconnected"

1. Ensure server is running with `npm run dev:custom`
2. Check browser console for connection errors
3. Verify user is properly authenticated
4. Check server logs for authentication issues

### If Test Messages Don't Appear

1. Verify WebSocket connection is established
2. Check that user has joined the test conversation room
3. Look for server-side broadcast logs
4. Ensure proper event listeners are attached

### If Emoji Picker Doesn't Work

1. Check for JavaScript errors in console
2. Verify click handlers are properly attached
3. Test click-outside functionality
4. Ensure proper focus management

The WebSocket implementation is now fully functional with enhanced chat features, proper file/image upload UI, working emoji picker, and comprehensive testing capabilities.
